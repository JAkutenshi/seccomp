# Web application for a Security Company

## Motivation
Study Spring Boot and Spring modules with basics of HTML/CSS. I want to gain basic experience in web programming with Java.

## Plan

1. Make objects page for viewing temporary information about a company.
2. Get familiar with Spring JPA and Hibernate. Export SQL presets in the project and connect DB (originally form SQLLite). Bind data from DB and objects page.
3. ToDo
